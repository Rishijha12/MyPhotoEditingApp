# MyPhotoEditingApp
I have used galary in code at the placeo of camera because not have device so if you want to test in device then change with camera.
Run app then click->capture->Edit->addFilter to apply filter 
If you found library then add library "fmPhotopicker" link is "github.com/congnd/FMPhotoPicker.git"
